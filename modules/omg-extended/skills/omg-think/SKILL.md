# Codex Port Notice

This skill was ported from upstream reference material. Interpret command names, paths, and agent-routing guidance as Codex/Oh My Game Kit equivalents. Prefer active Codex tools and local project instructions over Codex-specific mechanics when they conflict.

# Sequential Thinking

Structured problem-solving via manageable, reflective thought sequences with dynamic adjustment. Self-contained — thoughts live in conversation context only, no external persistence.

## When to Apply

- Complex problem decomposition
- Adaptive planning with revision capability
- Analysis needing course correction
- Problems with unclear/emerging scope
- Multi-step solutions requiring context maintenance
- Hypothesis-driven investigation/debugging
- Multi-module decision trees (which module should own this?)

## Core Process

### 1. Start with Loose Estimate
```
Thought 1/5: [Initial analysis]
```
Adjust dynamically as understanding evolves.

### 2. Structure Each Thought
- Build on previous context explicitly
- Address one aspect per thought
- State assumptions, uncertainties, realizations
- Signal what next thought should address

### 3. Apply Dynamic Adjustment
- **Expand**: More complexity discovered → increase total
- **Contract**: Simpler than expected → decrease total
- **Revise**: New insight invalidates previous → mark revision
- **Branch**: Multiple approaches → explore alternatives

### 4. Use Revision When Needed
```
Thought 5/8 [REVISION of Thought 2]: [Corrected understanding]
- Original: [What was stated]
- Why revised: [New insight]
- Impact: [What changes]
```

### 5. Branch for Alternatives
```
Thought 4/7 [BRANCH A from Thought 2]: [Approach A]
Thought 4/7 [BRANCH B from Thought 2]: [Approach B]
```
Compare explicitly, converge with decision rationale.

### 6. Generate & Verify Hypotheses
```
Thought 6/9 [HYPOTHESIS]: [Proposed solution]
Thought 7/9 [VERIFICATION]: [Test results]
```
Iterate until hypothesis verified.

### 7. Complete Only When Ready
Mark final: `Thought N/N [FINAL]`

Complete when:
- Solution verified
- All critical aspects addressed
- Confidence achieved
- No outstanding uncertainties

## Application Modes

**Explicit**: Use visible thought markers when complexity warrants visible reasoning or user requests breakdown. Good for `omg-plan` phase decomposition and `omg-debug` hypothesis testing.

**Implicit**: Apply methodology internally for routine problem-solving where thinking aids accuracy without cluttering response.

## OMG Integration

### With `omg-plan`
Use branching syntax for multi-module architecture decisions:
```
Thought 3/6 [BRANCH A]: Combat module owns damage calculation
Thought 3/6 [BRANCH B]: Balance module owns damage calculation
Thought 4/6 [DECISION]: Balance module — damage is a balance concern, not combat-specific
```

### With `omg-debug`
Use hypothesis generation for adversarial debugging:
```
Thought 1/4 [HYPOTHESIS]: Null ref caused by combat module's late init
Thought 2/4 [VERIFICATION]: Stack trace shows UI module, not combat
Thought 3/4 [REVISION of Thought 1]: UI module's OnEnable fires before combat injects
Thought 4/4 [FINAL]: Root cause — UI dependency on combat not declared in module.json
```

### With `omg-brainstorm`
Use scale game for feasibility assessment:
```
Thought 1/3: At 10 modules, sequential install takes 5s → acceptable
Thought 2/3: At 100 modules, sequential takes 50s → needs parallel
Thought 3/3 [FINAL]: Parallel install needed at >20 modules. Threshold: --parallel flag
```
