# Codex Port Notice

This skill was ported from upstream reference material. Interpret command names, paths, and agent-routing guidance as Codex/Oh My Game Kit equivalents. Prefer active Codex tools and local project instructions over Codex-specific mechanics when they conflict.

# Oh My Game Kit Watzup — Session Review

Session wrap-up: git history + state checks + task review. No delegation needed — built-in.

## Live Context (fetch on demand — do NOT inline in body)

When the user asks for a session wrap-up, fetch live context via tool calls AFTER the body is loaded — NEVER embed `` !`git log` `` or `` !`cat ...` `` here (cache-busts on every commit). Use:

- `Bash git log --oneline -10` → recent commits (use Bash; it's per-call execution, not body content)
- `Read .omg-module-summary.txt` → module summary (file may not exist; treat absence as "no modular kits")
- `TaskList` → in-progress and pending tasks

Skip silently if a source is unavailable — do not echo error.

## Process

Run all steps in order:

1. **Git history** — `git log --oneline -10` — list recent commits with types
2. **State check** — read console/logs for errors or warnings; note if clean
3. **Task check** — `TaskList` — list in-progress and pending tasks; flag blockers
4. **Completion gate audit** — for any code changes in session, check:
   - Gate 1: Were affected skills updated?
   - Gate 2: Is the codebase compiling/running cleanly?
   - Gate 3: Do new/modified systems have tests?
   - Gate 4: Module integrity — `omg-doctor` module checks pass? (if installedModules present)
5. **Telemetry review** (if `features.telemetry` enabled) — see Telemetry Section below
6. **Summary** — output structured status report

## Regression Detection

When telemetry data is available, compare error patterns across sessions:

1. Read `.agents/telemetry/errors-*.jsonl` — sort files by name (date order), take last 5
2. Parse current session errors vs prior sessions:
   - **New error type** (not seen in last 5 sessions): emit `[REGRESSION] {error_type} — not seen in last 5 sessions`
   - **Error count increase > 50%**: emit `[SPIKE] {error_type} — {N}x increase vs last session`
3. If no telemetry files exist: skip silently (no output)
4. Include regression/spike alerts in `### State` section of summary output

## Telemetry Section

If `features.telemetry` is enabled in any `omg-config-*.json`:

1. **Read** all `.agents/telemetry/*.jsonl` files (skip `archived/`)
2. **Aggregate**:
   - Errors: group by error pattern, count occurrences, show top 5
   - **Hook errors**: read `hook-errors-*.jsonl` — group by hook name, count failures, show top 5. If any hook has 3+ failures, recommend filing `omg-issue`
   - **Hook diagnostics**: read `hook-log-{today}.jsonl` and `hook-log-{yesterday}.jsonl` (if `features.hookLogging` enabled):
     - Error count per hook (entries with `crash: true`)
     - Median `durationMs` per hook name (timing profile)
     - Dedup hit rate for `hook-runner`: count `dedup=duplicate` vs `dedup=first` entries
     - Surface as sub-section: `### Hook Diagnostics` with hook name, avg duration, error count
   - Skill usage: rank by activation count, list never-used skills
   - Feature gaps: list unique queries with zero matching skills
3. **Present** in session summary under `### Telemetry` section
4. **Offer GitHub submission**: ask user "Submit telemetry to kit repo?"
5. **If approved**:
   - Determine target repo from `omg-config-*.json → repos.primary`
   - Create issue: `gh issue create --repo {repo} --title "[telemetry] Session report {date}" --label "telemetry" --body "{aggregated report}"`
   - Move processed files to `.agents/telemetry/archived/`
6. **If declined**: leave files for next session aggregation

## Future: AI-Aggregated Gotcha Generation

The telemetry data collected during `omg-watzup` sessions feeds into the **Self-Improving AI Pipeline** (see AGENTS.md). Error patterns aggregated across users will be used by a scheduled AI agent to auto-generate gotcha entries and preventive guidance, distributed to all users via kit releases. This skill's telemetry section is the **data source** for that pipeline.

**Status:** Not yet implemented. Currently telemetry is collected and optionally submitted as GitHub issues. The AI aggregation layer is planned.

## Scope

Session status review only — does NOT implement, modify, or commit.
